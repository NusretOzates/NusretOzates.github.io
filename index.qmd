As a **Machine Learning Engineer**, I build and refine end-to-end ML systems, handling tasks from data collection to model deployment on cloud platforms, with a focus on practical,
scalable solutions. I have 4 years of experience in **Natural Language Processing**, and even surprisingly to me, I am working on **Graph Neural Networks**, **Vision Transformers**, and
WSI Images for 3 years! I can even detect cancerous cells in pancreatic histology images by my eyes now...

I am also skilled in **MLOps**, using tools such as Kubeflow, FastAPI, and Transformers to automate and optimise the ML lifecycle.
Previously, I worked as an MLOps Engineer and a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at GLOSA and Carbon Consulting, respectively,
where I implemented an AutoNLP platform and led the development team of the AI department.

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from Koc University and several certifications, such as Google Cloud Certified Professional Machine Learning Engineer
and Certified Spark NLP Data Scientist. I am passionate about applying AI to enhance user experience and support data-driven decision-making across company services.

## My Published Articles

## What is What?

In the blogs section, I share whatever I learn about in a kind of detailed, structered and friendly way. I am also trying to
move my blog posts from Medium to here, so you can find my previous articles as well.

In the notes section, I decided share quick notes and commands that I find useful for my daily work.
