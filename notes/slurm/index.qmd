Here I will share the useful things I learned when using the SLURM cluster of my university.

This bash command shows the free memory, free number of CPUs, and used GPUs on the nodes in the "ai" partition.
You can use it to see available resources before submitting a job, which makes it easier to start jobs faster.

```bash
sinfo -O "NodeHost,FreeMem,CPUsState,GresUsed" -p ai
```
